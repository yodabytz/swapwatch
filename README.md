## 🛠 Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (with systemd)
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x
- **Python Modules**:
  - `psutil` (for system monitoring)
  - `curses` (usually included with Python)
  - `re` (for color processing)
  - Standard library modules: `logging`, `subprocess`, `datetime`, `time`, `os`

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yodabytz/swapwatch.git
   cd swapwatch
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip3 install psutil
   ```

3. **Set Up Themes (Optional)**

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/swapwatch/themes/
   sudo cp *.theme /etc/swapwatch/themes/
   ```

4. **Make Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x swapwatch.py
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### **Monitored Applications**
Edit the `monitored_apps` dictionary in `swapwatch.py` to include services you want managed:

```python
monitored_apps = {
    # process_name: (service_name, include_children)
    "clamd": ("clamav-daemon", False),
    "spamd": ("spamd", False),
    "dovecot": ("dovecot", False),
    "nginx": ("nginx", True),  # Include child processes
    "php-fpm8.2": ("php8.2-fpm", False),
    "mariadb": ("mariadb", False),
    # Add your services here...
}
```

### **Swap Thresholds**
Adjust thresholds as needed:

```python
SWAP_HIGH_THRESHOLD = 80  # Start action when swap exceeds 80%
SWAP_LOW_THRESHOLD = 65   # Target swap level after actions
```

### **Performance Tuning**
Modify timing intervals:

```python
CHECK_INTERVAL = 300         # Main monitoring check (5 minutes)
UI_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 3       # UI refresh rate (3 seconds)
```

## 🚀 Usage

### **Basic Usage**
```bash
sudo ./swapwatch.py
```

### **Command-Line Options**
```bash
# Custom thresholds
sudo ./swapwatch.py --swap-high 85 --swap-low 70

# Help
./swapwatch.py --help
```

### **Interactive Controls**
- **`m`** - Open service management menu
- **`t`** - Theme selector
- **`c`** - Force cache refresh for immediate data update
- **`?`** - Display help menu
- **`q`** - Quit application
- **↑/↓** - Navigate logs/menus

- **`Esc`** - Exit menus

## 📊 Performance Features

### **Cache Efficiency Display**
```
Perf: 87% cache hits, 15s adaptive cache
```
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Percentage of requests served from cache (higher = better)
- **Adaptive Timer**: Current cache duration (5s = stressed system, 30s = idle system)

### **Performance Benefits**
- **80-90% reduction** in file I/O operations
- **50-70% reduction** in CPU usage
- **85%+ cache hit rates** after initial warmup
- **VPS-optimized** resource usage patterns

### **Smart Behaviors**
- **Stress Detection**: Shortens cache time when system is under load
- **Idle Optimization**: Extends cache time when system is quiet
- **Batch Processing**: Single-pass data collection for efficiency
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles VPS permission restrictions

## 🎨 Customization

### **Color Themes**
Place `.theme` files in `/etc/swapwatch/themes/`:

```ini
# example.theme
background_bg=black
title_fg=cyan
swap_label_fg=magenta
percent_ok_fg=green
percent_high_fg=red
```

### **Log Colors**
SwapWatch 2.0 features intelligent color coding:
- 🟢 **Green**: Normal values, success states
- 🔴 **Red**: Warning values, problem conditions
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Threshold values
- 🔵 **Cyan**: Target values

## 📝 Log File

Default location: `/var/log/swapwatch.log`

Customize by modifying:
```python
LOG_FILE = "/var/log/swapwatch.log"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **VPS Permission Issues**
If cache clearing fails on VPS:
- SwapWatch 2.0 handles this gracefully
- Only logs success when cache clearing actually works
- No false positive messages

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Watch cache hit rates - should be >85% after warmup
- Adaptive cache time indicates system load
- Use 'c' key to force refresh when needed
